# The Mu2eII_SM21 Branch

This branch was created for the Mu2e-II Sensitivity and Simulations Group for the Mu2e-II Snowmass 2021 White Paper.

The code is written on top of Mu2e Offline. Although we maintain a connection to Mu2e Offlie, this branch will mostly be maintained by the **co-Convenors** of the Mu2e-II Snowmass 2021 Sensitivity Estimate working group:

**Lisa Goodenough, Sophie Middleton and Yuri Oksukian**.
